# deep-gen-models
Code from my Winter Break 2023-24 sprint [12/17/23 - 01/09/24] on training and doing toy experiments with GANs. I intend this repository to contain all future sidequests I do with other generative models too (e.g. Mamba, VAEs, Diffusion models, Normalizing Flows, Consistency models).
